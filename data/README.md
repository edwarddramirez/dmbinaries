1. Load the El-Badry eDR3 catalog (download link commented in the code)
2. Apply the various quality cuts discussed in the paper 
3. Correct G-band magnitudes of stars for extinction using the Bayestar 2015 map and estimate the masses of each star using MIST isochrones

## Special Requirement: 
* Need to download all_columns_catalog.fits file from arXiv:2101.05282v3

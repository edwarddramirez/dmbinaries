# Data
In this file, we have a Jupyter notebook to construct our binary sample:

1. Load the El-Badry eDR3 catalog
2. Apply the various quality cuts discussed in the paper 
3. Correct G-band magnitudes of stars for extinction using the Bayestar 2015 map and estimate the masses of each star using MIST isochrones

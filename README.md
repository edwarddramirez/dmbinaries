## Directory Structure
### 1. Monte Carlo Simulations
- Directory: shooter
  - Purpose: Simulate a flat distribution of binaries under the influence of high-speed perturbers to produce a present-day distribution of the binary projected separations.
### 2. Constraining the Perturber Abundance
- Directory: fitting
  - Purpose: Use the simulation results for the flat distribution of binaries to constrain the population of perturbers for binaries obeying more general initial semimajor axis distributions
